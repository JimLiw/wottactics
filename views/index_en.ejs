					<h2>Looking for help with warface maps</h2>
					<p>The warface map images are a little inconsistent but it's the best I could find. If you know of any site with consistent, good quality maps for warface. Or if you want to create those maps for warface, please get in touch.

					<h2>Future plans</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Support for drawing while panning
						<li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Better support for touch devices (pinch zoom, pan support)
						<li>Write text directly on the map
						<li>Share folders in addition to just tactics
					</ul>
					If you have any suggestions, you can put them on the forums, contact me by e-mail or put them in the survey.

				<h2>Video replay room</h2>
				<p>As you may have noticed there is a new 'video replay room' button next to the new room button. It's something new I'm experimenting with.
				
				<p>I was watching a League of Legends match and afterwards they were showing some replays to hilight certain things. I figured being to do that live and online is not something that exists yet and may be useful. 

				<p>Now, I'm not saying it's perfect. The drawing part is not a problem, but starting and keeping videos in sync especially through the youtube api is tricky. And I don't think it's something I can improve upon greatly. Basically the youtube API is just lacking the nescessary tools (no fine grained playback rate control, course seek function and play/pause delays).
				
				<p>A direct link to a supported video file (anything supported by your browser) will work better. But is there a even free video service that allows you to access video files directly and embed them remotely ?
				
				<p>Anyway give it a try and give me some feedback. Do you like the idea, do you have a use for it ? Does it work for you or your team ? What problems are you experiencing ? Does youtube video synchronization well enough or do you consider it unusable as it is ?

				<h2>Latest changes</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Implemented pinch zoom, 2 finger pan and full support for the eraser tool on touch devices
					<li>Moved to pixi v4.0.2, increased performance is definately measurable. Let me know if there are any issues though.
					<li>Added wot Paris map + updated blitz maps
					<li>Added 'lock camera' mode. Only available to owners (green), when selected all zoom/pan motions will be mimicked by all users in the room.
					<li>Made drawing more efficient but mostly everything drawn zoomed in will now remain sharp after a refresh or on clients. There will be changes in scaling on existing tactics (slightly thinner/thicker lines, larger/smaller arrow). I'm confident it will be consistent from now on though.  
				</ul> 
				On the bug hunting front:
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed alignment issues in video replay room.
					<li>The hand icon is no longer shown when dragging is disabled.
					<li>Text on firefox 49.0 was bigger than it should be. It's actually a FF bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1306027, but I remedied it best I can.
					<li>Some notes from older tactics dissapeared, they should be back now
					<li>Resizing a select box was jumpy sometimes
				</ul>
				If you find anything else, however small, that is broken, pls let me know.
